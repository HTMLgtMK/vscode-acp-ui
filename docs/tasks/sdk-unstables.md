# Task: SDK unstables evaluation

## Deliverable

Evaluate whether ACP UI should adopt additional SDK unstable APIs beyond those already in use.

## Already used

| API                             | Use                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `unstable_setSessionModel`      | Model picker after `session/new` |
| `extMethod` / `extNotification` | Cursor `cursor/*` methods        |

## Candidates to evaluate

| API                             | Notes                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unstable_resumeSession`        | Overlap with stable `session/load`                                                                                   |
| `unstable_forkSession`          | See `docs/acp/rfds/session-fork.mdx`                                                                                 |
| NES (next edit suggestions)     | See `docs/acp/rfds/next-edit-suggestions.mdx`                                                                        |
| Document sync                   | SDK extension surface                                                                                                |
| `elicitation` (form + url)      | Zed advertises when `AcpBetaFeatureFlag` is on, needs client UI ([client-capabilities.md](./client-capabilities.md)) |
| `session.configOptions.boolean` | Zed beta flag, composer UI ready, capability not advertised ([client-capabilities.md](./client-capabilities.md))     |

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Read SDK release notes and unstable method docs for `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`
- [ ] For each candidate: user value, agent support, overlap with stable v1
- [ ] Write short decision (adopt / defer / reject) in this file or changelog
- [ ] If adopting: separate implementation tasks filed

## Definition of done

1. Written recommendation for each listed unstable API.
2. No code required unless evaluation recommends adoption (then spin follow-up tasks).
