# Task: MCP servers forwarding

## Deliverable

Forward `mcpServers` from `.cursor/mcp.json` and/or extension settings on `session/new` and `session/load` instead of always passing `mcpServers: []`.

## Why

Cursor ACP docs describe MCP working when launching from a project with `.cursor/mcp.json`.
This client does not forward MCP definitions in RPC and relies entirely on agent-side discovery.

## Current behavior

| Area           | Today                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `session/new`  | Always `mcpServers: []`                     |
| `session/load` | Called with cwd, `mcpServers` is still `[]` |

## Key files

| Path                                        | Role                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `src/acp/infrastructure/acpAgentProcess.ts` | `newSession` / `loadSession` params   |
| New or existing config reader               | Parse `.cursor/mcp.json` and settings |

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Read MCP server definitions from workspace `.cursor/mcp.json`
- [ ] Optional override or merge from `ib-acp-ui` settings key (if added)
- [ ] Map to ACP `mcpServers` shape expected by SDK
- [ ] Pass on `session/new` and `session/load`
- [ ] Handle missing file (empty array, no error)
- [ ] Tests with fixture `mcp.json`
- [ ] `npm run verify` passes

## Definition of done

1. Session setup RPC includes MCP servers from the workspace when configured.
2. Behavior matches Cursor ACP docs expectation for project MCP config.
