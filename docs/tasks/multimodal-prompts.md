# Task: Multimodal prompts and structured `@` mentions

## Deliverable

1. Send multimodal `session/prompt` content (`image`, `audio`, `resource`, embedded context) when the agent advertises `promptCapabilities`.
2. Send structured `resource` blocks for composer `@` file mentions instead of only inserting paths into draft text.

## Why

Prompts are text-only today: `[{ type: "text", text }]`.
Agents with multimodal capabilities cannot receive images, audio, or structured file references from ACP UI.

## Current behavior

| Area                  | Today                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `session/prompt`      | Single text block                |
| Composer `@` mentions | Paths inserted into draft string |

## Key files

| Path                                             | Role                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `src/acp/infrastructure/acpAgentProcess.ts`      | `prompt()` content assembly |
| `src/acp/session/acpSessionBridge.ts`            | Send path from composer     |
| `webview/acp-ui/src/components/ChatComposer.tsx` | Mentions UI                 |

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Read agent `promptCapabilities` after `session/new` or `initialize`
- [ ] Build prompt content array from composer (text + attachments)
- [ ] Map `@` file picks to `resource` blocks per v1 content schema
- [ ] Support image/audio attach when capability allows (product UI TBD)
- [ ] Graceful fallback to text-only for agents without capabilities
- [ ] Tests for content assembly
- [ ] `npm run verify` passes

## Definition of done

1. File mentions in the composer produce structured ACP content when supported.
2. At least one multimodal type (e.g. `resource` or `image`) works end-to-end with a capable agent.
